# About Me

I'm Ahmed, a third-year student at the Faculty of Computer and Information Sciences, Mansoura University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence.

My journey in technology began during the 2020 lockdown, when I started experimenting with programming and software development. Over time, that curiosity evolved into a deep interest in machine learning and how data-driven systems can solve meaningful real-world problems.

I enjoy working across the full machine learning pipeline — from data exploration and cleaning to feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. I’m particularly interested in applied machine learning that supports decision-making in domains like healthcare, education, and public services.

My goal is to continue developing as an engineer by building practical projects, learning new techniques, and contributing to solutions that make a positive impact.
